## Architecture

This is a single Activity app that follows best practices like:
- Separation of concerns (Clean Architecture)
- Drive UI from data models
- Coroutines and flows
- Unidirectional Data Flow (UDF)
- Model-View-Intent (MVI)
- Dependency Injection (DI) -> Hilt

## UI

The app was designed using Material 3.

The Screen and UI elements are built entirely using [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/compose).

The app theme supports light and dark mode.
